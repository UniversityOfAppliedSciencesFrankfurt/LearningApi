# Ring Projection Pipeline Module
Ring Projection is a dimensional reduction method used in image recognition. The method converts two dimensional image into one dimensional function. The Ring-Projected algorithm is implemented as a Pipeline Module of LearningAPI. Beside implement RingProjectionModule, there are others pipeline modules that are also implemented for reporting the result as CSV file and to carry out the algorithm evaluation with certain test images and MNIST dataset of handwritten digits.
